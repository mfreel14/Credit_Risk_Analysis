# Credit Risk Analysis

## Project Overview - Credit Risk Analysis

 With our LoanStats CSV data, we'll apply machine learning to understand credit card risk.

Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans.  To solve for this we'll employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. For the project we'll use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling.

With the credit card dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, we’ll oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, we’ll use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Then, we’ll compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. THe results from the performance of these models will help us make a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.
